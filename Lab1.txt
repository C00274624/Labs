1.
Virtualization is enabled

2.
Fundamentally, cloud allows for infinitely better access to resources, as well as resource allocation all in a cost effective way

Pro:
Cost effective: allows for remote access to expensive equipment without paying full price
Scalability: allow resources to be utilized in tan dome even while having no geographical relation
Accessibility: remote access allows for quick responses to incidents. even when admin/staff are not available on site

Con:
Security Concerns: data stored on the cloud is inherently vulnerable to attack. This is inherited by nature of increasing its availability
Internet Dependency: Requiring a stable internet connection is a point of failure. the internet is often subject to instability in many scenarios for a multitude of reasons
Limited Control: This centralization of resources and assets increases the users dependency on the cloud provider. which also infers less control over your resource, if supplied by a third party 

3.
A hypervisor is responsible for managing and running virtual machines (VMs). It enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine by allocating resources such as CPU, memory, and storage

4.
A VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if it were a real machine. It operates independently and is managed by a hypervisor

5.
Hardware Efficiency: multiple VMs can run on a single physical server
Security & Isolation: VMs are isolated from each other, preventing system wide crashes
Portability: VMs can be easily moved or copied across different hardware
Cost Savings:  reduces the need for purchasing multiple physical machines
Backup & Recovery: VMs can be easily cloned and restored if needed

6.
Software Development: developers test applications in different OS environments.
Server Virtualization: businesses run multiple servers on fewer physical machines.
Cloud Computing Services: cloud providers host VMs for customers.
Penetration Testing: security professionals test systems in isolated environments.
Legacy Software Support: older applications can run on VMs without needing old hardware.

cloning a VM creates an exact copy, which can be used for testing, backup, or deploying multiple identical environments without setting them up manually
